## On Windows
These instructions were verified on VASSAL 3.2.15 and VASL 6.2.2

### Download the script
1. Right-click on the link [vasl_setup.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssmythe/vasl-setup/master/vasl_setup.bat), and chose "Save as..." the file to your Downloads folder

### Update the script
**If you want to use the default ASL directory location and VASL version, skip this step and move on to "Run the script"**

**Currently, the Enhanced Scenarios have been saved with VASL 6.2.2, so if you use a later version of VASL,
you'll get a warning message about needing to convert the scenarios to the newer version**

5. Click on the "vasl_setup.bat" file
6. Click the "Open" button
7. If you like, update the value for ASLROOT to wherever you want to setup the ASL files
8. If you like, update the value for VASLVERSION to the 3 digit version (important, don't use periods in the version number) of VASL you want to download (e.g. "630")
9. In the "vasl_setup.bat - WordPad" window, choose the "File > Save" menu option
10. Close WordPad
